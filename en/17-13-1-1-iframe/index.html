Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the most important indicator of national accounts, characterizing the state and development of the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic over a certain period.  It reflects the value of goods and services produced in a country and intended for final consumption, accumulation and export.                                                                                       The main indicators for calculating GDP by the production method are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Gross output (BB);</li>
  <li>Intermediate Consumption (PP);</li>
  <li>Gross value added (GVA) (3 = 1-2);</li>
  <li>Taxes on products (NP);</li>
  <li>Subsidies for products (JV);</li>
  <li>Net taxes on products (NPV) (6 = 4-5);</li>
  <li>Gross domestic product (7 = 3 + 6).                                                        c) The consumer Price Index (CPI) is a price index that is calculated for a specific group of goods and services that determine the composition of the consumer basket and is calculated over a certain period of time.                                                                                                 e) The state budget deficit is the amount of excess of budget expenditures over its revenues.                                                                              g) “Export of goods” means the export from the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic to the territory of another country of goods that reduce the reserves of the republic’s material resources.                                                      <br />
“Import of goods” is the import into the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic from the territory of another country of goods that are added to the reserves of the republic’s material resources.</li>

            <p>a, b) Gross value added is the difference between the cost of goods and services produced (output) and the cost of goods and services fully consumed during production (intermediate consumption).                                                            Intermediate consumption is the cost of consumed goods (excluding consumption of fixed capital) and consumed market services during the reporting period for the purpose of producing other goods and services.                                                                                                              Specific gravity - indicates the importance, value, or influence of someone or something among homogeneous phenomena in a particular area of human activity/society. The specific weight of tax, wages, profits, etc. is calculated. d) The Producer Price Index for Industrial products (PPI) is a relative indicator that is formed on the basis of prices of manufacturing enterprises and characterizes their average change in the industrial products they produce.                                                                           Producer prices of industrial products, basic manufacturing enterprises, base period, average base price, weights.                            e) State budget revenues consist of five main sources: taxes and other mandatory transfers levied by State units; property income received in connection with the ownership of assets; sales of goods and services; voluntary transfers received from other units; income from the sale of non-financial assets.                        Government budget expenditures include all non-refundable payments, regardless of whether they are reimbursable (i.e., paid in exchange for something) or gratuitous, and for what purposes they are carried out - for operating activities or for the acquisition of non-financial assets.</p>

            <p>“(a) The Production Account occupies a special place in the system of National Accounts (SNA), as it is the first account in a series of current accounts, and the methodology for its construction determines the methodology for constructing all subsequent accounts.                                                                                 The structure of GDP by type of economic activity or method of production at current prices in the system of national accounts shows the sectoral structure of economic growth, which allows us to obtain useful information about the results of the functioning of the economy. The calculation of GDP by the production method is carried out in SOM and in US dollars (at the official exchange rate of the NBKR). 
e) The amount of excess of budget revenues over its expenditures is called the budget surplus.
g) Accounting of goods in the statistics of foreign and mutual trade in goods is carried out on the basis of the general trading system, which takes into account all goods that are added to the reserves of material resources of the Kyrgyz Republic as a result of their importation into the territory of the Republic, or reduce the reserves of material resources of the Kyrgyz Republic as a result of their export from the territory of the republic outside the country.

Calculation of the consumer price index: at the first stage, individual price indices for goods and services are calculated.   At stage II, higher-level indices are created by aggregating individual price indices using the share of expenditures on the purchase of goods (services) in total household consumer spending. 
The CPI is calculated according to the modified Laspeyres formula.</p>

f) Foreign trade turnover is an economic indicator measured in monetary terms that characterizes the volume of a country’s foreign trade.                                                               The growth rate is a relative economic indicator showing the percentage growth of one indicator over the same indicator of the previous period.                                                                   <br />
 The country’s foreign trade balance is the ratio of the value of goods exported from the country to the value of goods imported into the country over a certain period of time.
g) The statistical value of the goods is the value of the goods determined by the terms
of the transaction, expressed in US dollars and SOM,
reduced to a single price base in accordance with the basic conditions of delivery of the goods.
The basic terms of delivery of the goods are determined according to the Rules
International Chamber of Commerce on the use of national and
International trade terms “Incoterms 2010”.
The statistical value of the product is indicated in conjunction with
the cost of delivering the goods to the border of the importing (exporting) country, converted into US dollars and SOM, respectively. When converting SOMS into US dollars, the exchange rate established by the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic at the time (date) of receipt of goods at the warehouse upon import and at the time (date) of shipment of goods from the warehouse upon export is applied.
As a general rule, the statistical cost is calculated:
a) for exported goods - at FOB prices - the price of the goods,
including its cost and all shipping costs to the border of the exporting country;
 b) for imported goods - at CIF prices - the price of the goods,
including its cost and the cost of insurance and transportation to the border of the importing country.
The statistical value of certain categories of goods is determined taking into account the following features:
a) for non-monetary gold, as well as collectible coins
made of precious metals that do not act as a means of payment, their commercial value is taken into account.;
b) in respect of banknotes, securities and coins that are not
In circulation, the cost of paper, metal, and the cost of printing and stamping them is taken into account, rather than their nominal value.;
c) with respect to recorded media
, the total cost of the media and the information contained therein is taken into account.
;
d) in respect of goods obtained as a result of processing
(compensating products), the total cost is taken into account (the cost
of goods to be processed and the value added as a result
of processing, including the cost of processing services).
Invoice value – the value stipulated by the terms
A trade transaction is the price of the goods actually paid or payable
, taking into account the terms of its delivery, i.e. indicated on the invoice.
Transportation costs and insurance may or may not be
included
